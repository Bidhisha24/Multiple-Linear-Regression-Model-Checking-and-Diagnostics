# Multiple-Linear-Regression-Model-Checking-and-Diagnostics
To fit a linear model to a data and check if the assumptions of Multiple Linear Regression holds for the data. The Life Expectancy Data of India over the years from 2000 to 2015 was used. To check for leverage and influential points using various methods such as checking for high values of Hat Matrix Diagonals, Cookâ€™s Distance Method, DFBETAS Method and DFFITS Method and check the overall Precision of model using COVRATIO Method and remove the high influential points to get a better model. After removal of the high influential points the Mean Squared Error (MSE) reduced by approximately 57.98% which indicates that our model improved to a significant extent.
